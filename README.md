### Summary

Investigating the average duration of movies over the years - 2011 to 2020 (Investigating-Netflix-Movies)
The assumption for this project is that the average duration of movies has been declining over the years, as evidence of this, 
I secured information relating to the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are said to be 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively.
If we're going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas and below are quick steps.
First I'll need to create a DataFrame from scratch.

### Project tools
 1. Analysis tool: Juptyer nootebook
 2. Language: Python 

### Project steps
 1. Loading data into a dictionary 
 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
 3. A visual inspection of our data
 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
 5. Filtering the dataset to pull out only information that relates to movies i.e., where type = "Movie"
 6. Creating a scatter plot
 7. Digging deeper
 8. Marking non-feature films
 9. Plotting with color!
